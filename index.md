# Garden Monitoring System
The Garden Monitoring System is an effecient way when it comes to cultivating the soil, it can come in handy when one owns planatations and even housplants. It helps nurish the plants by notifiying owners whether they have  exceeded with  watering their plants, sometimes to much of something isnt always great when it comes to planting!

# Final Milestone
My final milestone is the increased reliability and accuracy of my robot. I ameliorated the sagging and fixed the reliability of the finger. As discussed in my second milestone, the arm sags because of weight. I put in a block of wood at the base to hold up the upper arm; this has reverberating positive effects throughout the arm. I also realized that the forearm was getting disconnected from the elbow servo’s horn because of the weight stress on the joint. Now, I make sure to constantly tighten the screws at that joint.

# First Milestone
  

My first milestone was connecting the Soil Mositure Sensor to the Aurdino. I connected the red LED and the Green Led onto the breadboard, this will allow me to know wether the soil is moisturized, it will blink green if the soil is already  mositurized but if its dry and needs water, the red LED light will blink. While this is happening, the serial monitor will be printing, "time to water the plant" or "doesn't need watering", this is a reuslt after coding  into the Void loop in the aurdino app, allowing for this to be a constant thing that the aurdino will detect and run more than once. In order to test this out and see it was accurate, I placed the sensor into a cup of water,there the aurdino measured the watervalue which was 386. In other words, that was the range for what is considered mositurized. Having discovered that, it was time to put it into test and see if the sensor will be detect differently if placed into dry soil. I placed the the soil moisturized sensor into dry plant and the red led light automatically started glowing and the serial monitor printed, "time to water plant" as it showed that it had a value of not 386 but 500.
